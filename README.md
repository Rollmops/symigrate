# Symigrate
This package contains the tool ``symigrate`` which aims to be a migration 
tool for scripts.

Like [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) does migrations for the database with
*SQL* files, ``symigrate`` does migrations for the system with script files.


## Installation
*Symigrate* can be installed via pip:

> pip3 install symigrate
